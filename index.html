                <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
                    <h2>Why Learn From Me?</h2>
                    <p>I’ve spent the last 18 years testing, researching, and teaching the hidden science of
                        communication. I’ve helped millions of students master their people skills, now I want to share
                        my method with you. My work has been featured in Forbes, CNN, BBC, Entrepreneur, and Inc., and
                        many more. My bestselling books <em>Captivate</em> and <em>Cues</em> have reached readers around
                        the world and been translated into over 18 languages.</p>
                    <p>But my proudest work isn’t just writing about communication — it’s proving what actually works in
                        the real world. I’ve tested my frameworks with:</p>
                    <ul class="check-list">
                        <li>Fortune 500 executives and global organizations</li>
                        <li>Educators and therapists guiding the next generation</li>
                        <li>Entrepreneurs, coaches, and professionals building their dream careers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What I’ve discovered is this: when you unlock the right communication tools, everything changes —
                        confidence grows, relationships deepen, opportunities open. I’ve watched this change lives and I
                        want to empower more people.</p>
                    <p><strong>That’s why I need your help.</strong></p>
                    <p>I can only be in so many rooms at once. This certification exists because I want more leaders,
                        more coaches, more facilitators, and more changemakers out there teaching these methods.
                        Together, we can spread this message further than I ever could alone.</p>
                    <p>If you’ve ever felt called to empower others with kindness, warmth, and clarity — this is your
                        invitation to join me.</p>

                    people you will serve.</p>

                <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

                        $9,995</div>
                    <p>Tuition</p>
                </div>

                <p>Why? Because this isn’t a quick course or a weekend seminar. This is a professional-level credential,
                    designed for leaders who are ready to step into a new level of authority and impact.</p>

                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <p><strong>With this certification, our goal is to equip you to:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="check-list">
                        <li>Lead corporate training workshops inside organizations.</li>
                        <li>Raise your coaching rates and expand your practice.</li>
                        <li>Gain recognition in your organization as the in-house expert.</li>
                        <li>Market yourself differently by adding a world-class credential to your toolkit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>And the best part: communication skills are universal. Whether you’re a business coach,
                    high-performance coach, therapist, teacher, or even a romance coach — these frameworks flex to every
                    area of human interaction. Everyone needs better communication. So as your career grows and goals
                    change, the certification can always be used as a tool.</p>

                        <li>Recertification checks to ensure you remain at the highest standard of mastery.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--color-text-light); margin-top: 1rem;">This keeps the
                        certification prestigious and respected — when people see this credential, they know it means
                        something.</p>

                        reflects the seriousness of the work. But we also want it to be accessible for the right people.
                        That’s why we offer a monthly payment plan in addition to the one-time tuition.</p>

                    <h3>How long does it take to complete the program?</h3>
                    <p>The certification is designed to be completed in 3 months, but it’s self-paced — you can move
                        faster or slower depending on your schedule. We will have live teaching sessions during the 3
                        months, so we encourage you to watch each module before the live sessions so we can answer your
                        questions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>What’s the time commitment each week?</h3>
                    <p>Expect to spend about 3–5 hours per week engaging with the modules, practicing, and reflecting.
                        Because it’s self-paced, you can structure it around your life and work.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Are there pre-requisites?</h3>
                    <p>There are no pre-requisites, however Vanessa’s book Cues: The Secret Language of Charismatic
                        Communication is required reading in the training and will be used extensively. The more you are
                        familiar with the material the better, but absolutely not required ahead of time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Do I need to be an experienced coach to apply?</h3>
                    <p>No — but we are looking for folks with relevant experience. This program is for people who
                        already lead, guide, or teach others in some capacity: managers, HR leaders, coaches,
                        therapists, teachers, facilitators, and organizational trainers. If you’re already helping
                        people, this certification will give you the frameworks to help them more effectively.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Can I use this certification in my existing coaching or therapy practice?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! That is our fondest wish. These tools are built to be flexible and can be applied across
                        fields — from corporate training and leadership coaching to relationship coaching and therapy.
                        Everyone needs communication, and you’ll have a framework that adapts to your specialty.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Can I use this certification inside my company?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Many applicants are intrapreneurs — leaders inside organizations who want to run
                        trainings, lead workshops, or be the “in-house expert” on communication. This certification
                        gives you the credibility and content to do exactly that. Let us know if your company would like
                        to buy a license for multiple trainers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Is there a payment plan available?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. We offer a monthly payment plan in addition to the one-time tuition. You’ll see the options
                        during the application process.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Why is there a $500 annual renewal?</h3>
                    <p>The renewal ensures your certification stays current and respected. It covers updated materials
                        and research, access to quarterly live office hours, membership in the private community, and
                        recertification checks to uphold standards. This way, when people see you hold this credential,
                        they know it represents ongoing mastery, not a one-time course.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Will this guarantee me clients or higher income?</h3>
                    <p>We cannot promise revenue — but we designed this program to give you tools you can immediately
                        apply to grow your practice, charge higher rates, and lead trainings. Most importantly, it
                        elevates your credibility and authority. What you do with that will be up to you — but we
                        believe it will give you a powerful edge.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Can I customize the curriculum?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Our materials are designed to fit your branding, flavor and perspective if you wish. Our
                        hope is for you to take our curriculum and fit it into your existing practice or teaching.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>How do I apply?</h3>
