                    <h2>Why Learn From Me?</h2>
                    <p>I’ve spent the last 18 years testing, researching, and teaching the hidden science of
                        communication. I’ve helped millions of students master their people skills, now I want to share
                        my method with you. My work has been featured in Forbes, CNN, BBC, Entrepreneur, and Inc., and
                        many more. My bestselling books <em>Captivate</em> and <em>Cues</em> have reached readers around
                        the world and been translated into over 18 languages.</p>
                    <p>But my proudest work isn’t just writing about communication — it’s proving what actually works in
                        the real world. I’ve tested my frameworks with:</p>
                    <ul class="check-list">
                        <li>Fortune 500 executives and global organizations</li>
                        <li>Educators and therapists guiding the next generation</li>
                        <li>Entrepreneurs, coaches, and professionals building their dream careers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What I’ve discovered is this: when you unlock the right communication tools, everything changes —
                        confidence grows, relationships deepen, opportunities open. I’ve watched this change lives and I
                        want to empower more people.</p>

                        faster or slower depending on your schedule. We will have live teaching sessions during the 3
                        months, so we encourage you to watch each module before the live sessions so we can answer your
                        questions.</p>

                    <h3>What’s the time commitment each week?</h3>
                    <p>Expect to spend about 3–5 hours per week engaging with the modules, practicing, and reflecting.
                        Because it’s self-paced, you can structure it around your life and work.</p>

                    <h3>Are there pre-requisites?</h3>
                    <p>There are no pre-requisites, however Vanessa’s book Cues: The Secret Language of Charismatic
                        Communication is required reading in the training and will be used extensively. The more you are
                        familiar with the material the better, but absolutely not required ahead of time.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need to be an experienced coach to apply?</h3>
                    <p>No — but we are looking for folks with relevant experience. This program is for people who
                        already lead, guide, or teach others in some capacity: managers, HR leaders, coaches,
                        therapists, teachers, facilitators, and organizational trainers. If you’re already helping
                        people, this certification will give you the frameworks to help them more effectively.</p>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Can I use this certification in my existing coaching or therapy practice?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! That is our fondest wish. These tools are built to be flexible and can be applied across
                        fields — from corporate training and leadership coaching to relationship coaching and therapy.
                        Everyone needs communication, and you’ll have a framework that adapts to your specialty.</p>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <h3>Can I use this certification inside my company?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Many applicants are intrapreneurs — leaders inside organizations who want to run
                        trainings, lead workshops, or be the “in-house expert” on communication. This certification
                        gives you the credibility and content to do exactly that. Let us know if your company would like
                        to buy a license for multiple trainers.</p>

                    <p>Yes. We offer a monthly payment plan in addition to the one-time tuition. You’ll see the options

                    <p>The renewal ensures your certification stays current and respected. It covers updated materials
                        and research, access to quarterly live office hours, membership in the private community, and
                        recertification checks to uphold standards. This way, when people see you hold this credential,
                        they know it represents ongoing mastery, not a one-time course.</p>

                    <h3>Will this guarantee me clients or higher income?</h3>
                    <p>We cannot promise revenue — but we designed this program to give you tools you can immediately
                        apply to grow your practice, charge higher rates, and lead trainings. Most importantly, it
                        elevates your credibility and authority. What you do with that will be up to you — but we
                        believe it will give you a powerful edge.</p>
